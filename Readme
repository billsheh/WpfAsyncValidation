The usage of this library is very straightforward:

    private int _age;
    [ValidateAge(ErrorMessage = "Age is not valid")]
    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set
        {
            if (_age != value)
            {
                _age = value;
                RaisePropertyChangedEvent(() => Age);
                ValidatePropertyAsync(value, () => Age, null);
            }
        }
    }
  
It simplifies how to call the validation for properties. It also can capture the type conversion error, which you will not see in the WPF asynchronous validation code in the Internet.
